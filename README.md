# Project Wingman

Today, there are too many ways to communicate. Furthermore, it can become pricey, counter-intuitive and overwhelming with the number of apps available to drive the conversation. Outdated platforms, users without a computer, people with no internet access. It all adds up to the problem.

Project Wingman aims to solve that by connecting all the communications in one. Imagine Segment, but for communications. Project Wingman runs on the Twilio platform and talks directly to other Platform API's to make a consistent messaging experience from one platform.
